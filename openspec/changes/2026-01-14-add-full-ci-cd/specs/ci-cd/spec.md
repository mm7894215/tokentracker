### Requirement: Automated CLI release on main

The system SHALL publish the CLI package to npm automatically on main when the version is new, and SHALL skip publishing when the version already exists.

#### Scenario: Publish new version

- **WHEN** main is updated with a version not yet published to npm

### Requirement: Manual MCP deployment gate for functions

The system SHALL require manual confirmation of MCP deployment when Insforge functions change on main.

#### Scenario: Functions changed

- **THEN** the release workflow SHALL require manual MCP confirmation
- **AND** release completion SHALL be blocked until confirmation is provided

### Requirement: Preflight database checks before release

The system SHALL run preflight checks that validate required database tables exist before release completion.

#### Scenario: Preflight check fails

- **WHEN** scripts/acceptance/model-identity-alias-table.cjs fails
